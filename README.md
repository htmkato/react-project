# react-project

This is a project made mainly to study about and practice [atomic design][1] and testing with [Jest][2].

The project might expand as I discover and try new technologies.

There are additional libraries to make development and styling easier, like [Vite][3], [Tailwind CSS][4] and [Yarn (modern)][5]
